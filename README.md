# Osmium Library

http://osmcode.org/libosmium

A fast and flexible C++ library for working with OpenStreetMap data.

NOTE: This is an alpha version of the next-generation Osmium. For production
use, see the Osmium version at https://github.com/joto/osmium .

There are a few applications that use the Osmium library in the examples directory.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/osmcode/libosmium.png)](http://travis-ci.org/osmcode/libosmium)

## Prerequisites

Because Osmium uses many C++11 features you need a modern compiler and standard
C++ library. Osmium needs at least GCC 4.7.3 or clang (LLVM) 3.2. (Some parts may
work with older versions.)

Different parts of Osmium (and the applications built on top of it) need
different libraries. You DO NOT NEED to install all of them, just install those
you need for the programs you need.

    boost (several libraries)
        http://www.boost.org/
        Debian/Ubuntu: libboost-dev
        openSUSE: boost-devel
        Homebrew: boost

    boost-program-options (for parsing command line options)
        http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/doc/html/program_options.html
        Debian/Ubuntu: libboost-program-options-dev

    zlib (for PBF and gzip support)
        http://www.zlib.net/
        Debian/Ubuntu: zlib1g-dev
        openSUSE: zlib-devel

    bz2lib (for bzip2 support)
        http://www.bzip.org/
        Debian/Ubuntu: libbz2-dev

    GDAL (for OGR support)
        http://gdal.org/
        Debian/Ubuntu: libgdal1-dev
        openSUSE: libgdal-devel
        Homebrew: gdal

    Expat (for parsing XML files)
        http://expat.sourceforge.net/
        Debian/Ubuntu: libexpat1-dev
        openSUSE: libexpat-devel

    GEOS (for assembling multipolygons etc.)
        http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
        Debian/Ubuntu: libgeos++-dev
        openSUSE: libgeos-devel

    Google sparsehash
        http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash/
        Debian/Ubuntu: libsparsehash-dev
        openSUSE: sparsehash
        Homebrew: google-sparsehash

    Google protocol buffers (for PBF support)
        http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ (at least version 2.3.0 needed)
        Debian/Ubuntu: libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
        openSUSE: protobuf-devel
        Homebrew: protobuf
        Also see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format

    Doxygen (to build API documentation)
        http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
        Debian/Ubuntu: doxygen

    libboost-test (for tests)
        http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html
        Debian/Ubuntu: libboost-test-dev

    OSMPBF (for PBF support)
        https://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary
        Debian/Ubuntu: libosmpbf-dev

You need to either install the packages for your distribution or install those
libraries from source. Most libraries should be available in all distributions.


## Files

* Doxyfile: Needed for building the Osmium C++ docs, call "make doc" to build.

* include: C/C++ include files. All of Osmium is in those header files which
  are needed for building Osmium applications.

* examples: Osmium example applications.

* test: Tests (see below).


## Building

Osmium is a header-only library, so there is nothing to build for the
library itself.

Call "make doc" in the top-level directory to build the Osmium C++ docs.

Call "make install" to install the include files and documentation.

Call "make clean" to clean up.

To build the examples go to the "examples" directory and type "make".

For Mac users: If you have clang 3.2 or newer, use the system compiler.
If not you have to build the compiler yourself. See the instructions
on http://clang.llvm.org/ .


## Testing

There are a few unit tests using the boost unit test framework in the "test"
directory. Many more tests are needed, any help appreciated.

Run "make test" from the main directory or go to the "test" directory and type

    ./run_tests.sh
    
to compile and run the tests. You can run a single test by calling 

    ./run_test.sh TESTFILE

for instance:

    ./run_test.sh t/basic/test_node.cpp

In addition there are some test based on the OSM Test Data Repository at
http://osmcode.org/osm-testdata/ . Go into the test/osm-testdata directory
and type 'make' to run them all.
